Research Paper For Kevy
========
Written by Ryan Snodgrass

Cloud computing has become a very hot topic in recent years. For many the term remains hard to understand. A good [article](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/whitepaper/understanding-the-cloud-computing-stack-saas-paas-iaas) written by the cloud infrastructure provider Rackspace provides an excellent introduction to the concept. In the article, it breaks down the concept into 3 different and broad areas of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.

>- SaaS applications are designed for end-users, delivered over the web 
>- PaaS is the set of tools and services designed to make coding and deploying those applications quick and efficient 
>- IaaS is the hardware and software that powers it all – servers, storage, networks, operating systems

All these services are running over the internet, or the "cloud." With so many cloud apps, having them play nice with each other is often time consuming and costly. Kevy provides a pre-built integration between all of a client's favorite cloud based applications that takes data from one application and turns it into something usable for the other application. Kevy comes in underneath the SaaS layer, but, between the PaaS. Kevy provides a great introduction to this on their ['Meet Kevy'](http://kevy.com/resources#videos) video.

Who Are Kevy's Competitors And How Do They Differentiate?
--------

Currently there are a handful of mammoth services with large budgets and many integrations. The bigger ones are made by well known names like Dell, Microsoft, and Amazon. There are many players in the cloud integration market. Wikipedia has a [list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based_integration#Significant_Players) of popular integration platforms totaling 29 different providers. (Kevy was not listed.)

####MuleSoft
One of the big names in cloud integration. Mulesoft is different by being a small company under 500 that delivers on SaaS, PaaS, and iPaaS. They have many vendors and break them down into those categories.

####Boomi Atomsphere
Now by Dell. Boomi Atomsphere is one of the leaders in the market and according to this [artice](http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/1614705) dated 2010 one of the first Platform as a Service providers to market. Featuring three products now- prebuilt integrations, API access to the integration, and custom coded solutions.

####Informatica
Offering Enterprise level integrations. In 2012 they were named the #1 best selling integration platform for 4 years running found [here](http://www.informaticacloud.com/company/news/press-releases/389-informatica-receives-integration-appexchange-best-of-11-award-from-salesforcecom-customers.html). In an 'independent' [review](http://sellmorenow.com/crm-review/informatica/) Informatica was found to have introduced the industry’s first usage-based data integration service, Informatica Cloud Express, in its Winter 2010 Release. Informatica Cloud Express allows users to easily schedule data loading tasks between databases/files and CRM, all without coding.

The key difference between these apps and Kevy is the first glance complexity from these companies. Gleaning just from their websites shows a plethora of features with obvious power. But, with that power comes complexity. From a couple of articles and blog posts comes a common consensus toward lack of developer support.  Meaning many of these products expect their clients to have in house developers to hook into the cloud integration service.

Recent Innovations In Cloud Integration
------
Only in the last two years has the term Integration Platform as a Service existed. In an article published by Gartner in early 2012: a new service was outlined that we know now as iPaaS. You have to be a member of Gartner to view the original document, but Information Week has an [article](http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/platform-as-a-service/meet-ipaas-gartner-ranks-new-cloud-service-pioneers/d/d-id/1113882) dated 2/19/2012 outlining the report.

Not necessarily an innovation, but certainly good news: according to an article at [www.idevnews.com](http://www.idevnews.com/stories/6179/Survey-Increases-in-SaaS-Adoption-Fuel-Growth-Interest-in-iPaaS-Cloud-Integration) dated May 5th this year states that a survey done by SnapLogic finds that more and more medium to large firms are looking to move towards SaaS products which will only fuel more interest in iPaaS providers to keep costs down. However, this interest also brings concerns about data-privacy and security.

Cloud Computing Journal has an [article](http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/2914476) dated 1/6/2014 that says customization will become the new hot topic for 2014.
>Liaison predicts that in 2014 there will be dramatic growth in data integration complexity, mass customization will become the norm and the convergence of business-to-business (B2B) and application-to-application (A2A) integration will be a top priority.

This seems to be at odds to Kevy's niche to keep everything pre-built for the clients. If Kevy is pre-building all their options so they can just point and click on what has already been built, how custom can Kevy's product be? The client would have to contact Kevy for any new connections or features not present.

Who Would benefit from Kevy?
------
Kevy sells pre-built integration modules that clients drag and drop into working order. Since Kevy is still a small company: it can react to changes in the market quicker than its larger competitors. With that small size; however, comes difficulty supporting custom enterprise level integration. Therefore Kevy would be a great fit for smaller companies looking for an integration that 'just works.'
