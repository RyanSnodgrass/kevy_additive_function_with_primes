Research Paper For Kevy
========
Written by Ryan Snodgrass

Cloud computing has become a very hot topic in recent years. For many the term remains hard to understand. A good [article](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/whitepaper/understanding-the-cloud-computing-stack-saas-paas-iaas) written by the cloud infrastructure provider Rackspace provides an excellent introduction to the concept. In the article, it breaks down the concept into 3 different and broad areas of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.

>- SaaS applications are designed for end-users, delivered over the web 
>- PaaS is the set of tools and services designed to make coding and deploying those applications quick and efficient 
>- IaaS is the hardware and software that powers it all – servers, storage, networks, operating systems

All these services are running over the internet, or the "cloud." Kevy comes in underneath the SaaS layer, but, between the PaaS. Kevy actually provides a great video that explains this on their ['Meet Kevy'](http://kevy.com/resources#videos) video.

Who Are Kevy's Competitors And How Do They Differentiate?
--------

Currently there are a handful of mammoth services with large budgets and many integrations. The bigger ones are made by well known names like Dell, Microsoft, and Amazon. There are many players in the cloud integration market. Wikipedia has a list of popular integration platforms totalling 29 different providers. Kevy was not listed.

####MuleSoft
One of the big names in cloud integration. Mulesoft is different by being a small company under 500 that delivers on SaaS, PaaS, and iPaaS. They have many vendors and break them down into those categories.

####Boomi Atomsphere
Now by Dell. Boomi Atomsphere is one of the leaders in the market and according to this [artice](http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/1614705) dated 2010 one of the first Platform as a Service providers to market. Featuring three products now- prebuilt integrations, API access to the integration, and custom coded solutions.


The key difference between these apps and Kevy is the first glance complexity from these companies. Gleening just from their websites shows a plethora of features with obvious power. But, with that power comes complexity. From a couple of articles and blog posts comes a common consesnus toward lack of developer support.  Meaning many of these products expect their customers to have in house developers to hook into the cloud integration service.

Recent Innovations In Cloud Integration
------
Not necessarily an innovation, but certainly good news: according to an article at [www.idevnews.com](http://www.idevnews.com/stories/6179/Survey-Increases-in-SaaS-Adoption-Fuel-Growth-Interest-in-iPaaS-Cloud-Integration) dated May 5th this year

Who Would benefit from Kevy?
------
Kevy sells pre-built integration modules that clients drag and drop into working order. Since Kevy is still a small company: it can react to changes in the market quicker than its larger competitors. With that small size; however, comes difficulty supporting custom enterprise level integration. Therefore Kevy would be a great fit for smaller companies looking for an integration that 'just works.'
